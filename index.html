      <h2>Once upon a time you dressed so fine</h2>
      <p>You threw the bums a dime in your prime didn't you</p>
      <p>People'd call say beware doll you're bound to fall</p>
      <p>You thought they were all kiddin' you</p>
      <p>You used to laugh about</p>
      <h2>Everybody that was hangin' out</h2>
      <p>Now you don't talk so loud</p>
      <p>Now you don't seem so proud</p>
      <p>About having to be scrounging for your next meal</p>
      <p>How does it feel</p>
      <p>How does it feel</p>
      <h3>To be without a home</h3>
      <p>Like a complete unknown</p>
      <p>Like a rolling stone</p>
      <p>You've gone to the finest school all right miss lonely</p>
      <p>But you know you only used to get juiced in it</p>
      <p>Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street</p>
      <p>And now you're gonna have to get used to it</p>
      <p>You said you'd never compromise</p>
      <p>With the mystery tramp but now you realize</p>
      <p>He's not selling any alibis</p>
      <p>As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes</p>
      <p>And say do you want to make a deal</p>
      <h4>How does it feel</h4>
      <p>How does it feel</p>
      <p>To be on your own</p>
      <p>With no direction home</p>
      <h4>A complete unknown</h4>
      <p>Like a rolling stone</p>
      <p>You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns</p>
      <p>When they all did tricks for you</p>
      <p>You never understood that it ain't no good</p>
      <p>You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you</p>
      <p>You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat</p>
      <h5>Who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat</h5>
      <p>Ain't it hard when you discover that</p>
      <p>He really wasn't where it's at</p>
      <p>After he took from you everything he could steal</p>
      <p>How does it feel</p>
      <p>How does it feel</p>
      <p>To have be on your own</p>
      <h5>With no direction home</h5>
      <p>Like a complete unknown</p>
      <p>Like a rolling stone</p>
      <h1>Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people</h1>
      <p>They're all drinkin' thinkin' that they got it made</p>
      <p>Exchanging all precious gifts</p>
      <p>But you'd better take your diamond ring you'd better pawn it babe</p>
      <p>You used to be so amused</p>
      <p>At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used</p>
      <p>Go to him now he calls you you can't refuse</p>
      <p>When you ain't got nothing you got nothing to lose</p>
      <h2>You're invisible now you got no secrets to conceal</h2>
      <p>How does it feel</p>
      <p>Ah how does it feel</p>
      <p>To be on your own</p>
      <h2>With no direction home</h2>
      <p>Like a complete unknown</p>
      <p>Like a rolling stone</p>
